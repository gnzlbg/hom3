# High-Order Multiphysics Multiscale Methods

HOM&#179; is a framework for solving complex system of PDEs using hierarchical
grids. It is also a library for building and coupling solvers to study
multiphysics problems.

The library provides: 
 
  - a hierarchical mesh data structure,  
  - utilities for scalable I/O, resource management, parallelization in  
    heterogeneous supercomputers,  
  - and efficient coupling algorithms.  

To try it out take a look at the [getting started guide]({{site.baseurl}}/getting_started) and
the [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation).

If you are interested in contributing check out the [development
guide]({{site.baseurl}}/development).
